The file used for testing, filename, was 1 MB in size. When reading
in the file 1 byte per read, it was noted that system calls (read)
took way longer than C function calls (fgetc). This trend continued
until 2048 bytes per read was tested. After this point, unix system
calls were faster than the c function calls. In conclusion, it was 
noted that unix system calls are faster for reading when more bytes
per read is required, otherwise C function calls are faster. It was
also noted that the time to read a file decreased as more bytes were
read per read.
